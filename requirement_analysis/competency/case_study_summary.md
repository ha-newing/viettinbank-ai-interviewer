## Strategic Questions & Reference Answers

### Question 1: Customer Segment Prioritization

**Question**: With a 15% credit growth target for 2026, which customer segments should the branch prioritize? Explain reasoning and propose approach strategy.

**Ideal Answer Framework**:

**Priority Segment 1: Corporate Large (KHDN Lớn)**
- Rationale:
  - Foundation of branch (42% profit, 55.2% loan balance)
  - NPL only 1.2% (well below 2.0% target)
  - 28% leaving due to slow approval process
  - Cross-selling potential (current 28% vs benchmark 45%)
- Strategy:
  - Improve service quality and speed
  - Invest in technology for faster approval
  - Focus on Cash Management and Trade Finance

**Priority Segment 2: Retail Premium (KHCN Cao cấp)**
- Rationale:
  - Highest ROE (32.1%) and lowest NPL (0.4%)
  - Strong growth (+12.8%)
  - 62% demand Wealth Management
  - 366B VND AUM opportunity
- Strategy:
  - Develop Wealth Management services
  - Digital experience enhancement
  - Personalized advisory services

**SME Approach**: Do NOT prioritize growth. Instead:
- Tighten credit scoring (min score 600→650)
- Restructure/divest distressed accounts
- Support only high-quality SMEs with tech solutions

**Scoring Criteria**:
- Strategic Thinking: Data-driven analysis, clear prioritization logic
- Risk Balance: Considers NPL implications, avoids high-risk expansion
